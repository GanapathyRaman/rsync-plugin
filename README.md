## How to Use Rsync on Windows Using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

On Windows, `rsync` is not natively available, but you can easily use it through **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**. Here's how to set it up:

### Steps:

#### 1. Install WSL
- If you haven't already, install WSL by following the official Microsoft guide:  
  ðŸ‘‰ [Install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)  
- Once installed, open the WSL terminal (search for **WSL** or your chosen Linux distro like Ubuntu).  

#### 2. Install rsync in WSL
Run the following commands in the WSL terminal:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install rsync
```

#### 3. Find the Path to rsync in WSL
Run:
```bash
which rsync
```
The typical path is something like:  
```
/usr/bin/rsync
```

#### 4. Configure the Plugin
In Obsidian, set the **Rsync Binary Path** in the plugin settings to the WSL `rsync` path. Example:
```
C:\Users\<YourUserName>\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\rootfs\usr\bin\rsync
```
Alternatively, use the `wsl` command to invoke `rsync` in WSL:
```bash
wsl rsync
```

#### 5. Use the Plugin
Once configured, you can use the Rsync Plugin in Obsidian as you would on a Unix-based system, syncing files to and from remote servers.  

## Configuration Options

| Option                | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| **Rsync Binary Path** | Path to the `rsync` executable (use WSLâ€™s path if on Windows). |
| **Remote IP**         | The IP address of the remote server. |
| **SSH Port**         | The SSH port for connecting to the remote server. |
| **SSH Username**     | The SSH username for the remote server. |
| **SSH Password**     | (Optional) SSH password for authentication. |
| **Private Key Path** | (Optional) Path to your SSH private key. |
| **Local Directory Path** | Path to the local directory you want to sync. |
| **Remote Directory Path** | Path to the remote directory to sync. |
| **Sync Direction**   | Choose between push (local to remote) or pull (remote to local). |
| **Dry Run**          | Enable to simulate the sync without actually making changes. |
| **Log File Path**    | Path to save logs of the sync operation. |
| **Exclude Patterns** | Patterns of files or directories to exclude from syncing. |
| **Schedule Interval** | Interval (in minutes) for periodic syncs. |

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure `rsync` is installed and accessible on your system (via WSL for Windows users).  
- Verify your SSH credentials (username, password, or private key) for remote server access.  
- Check the paths for both local and remote directories to ensure they're correctly configured.
